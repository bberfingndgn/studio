- Animated Companion: An interactive character that offers simple, positive encouragement and emotional feedback based on timer status, with dynamically generated encouragements.
- Garden Visualization: An area where fully-grown flowers (representing completed study goals) are permanently collected, visualizing the user's entire study history.
- Achievement System: Digital badges are awarded for reaching key milestones in time studied or consistency.
- Personalized Study Plan Generator: Generative AI creates a personalized study plan tool based on the student's subjects, available time, and learning preferences, recommending optimal study durations and break intervals.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft teal (#76D7C4) to promote a calm and focused environment. 
- Background color: Very light, desaturated teal (#E0F8F0), creating a gentle backdrop for the interface.
- Accent color: A muted green (#A9DFBF), complementing the teal and contributing to the garden aesthetic. This color would apply to elements of interactivity or significance, without distracting from the rest of the experience.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for headlines and body, offering both a contemporary look and some warmth/personality. This contrasts nicely with the geometric and modern timer display and contributes to a balance of focus and encouragement.
- Use cheerful and playful icons related to growth and learning.
- Clean and spacious design with rounded corners to create a friendly and approachable interface.
- Subtle, engaging animations for flower growth, achievement unlocks, and companion character interactions.
